The website utilizes the Parallax effect to create an immersive experience. 

The navigation menu smoothly transitions from a column layout to a streamlined row, ensuring ease of access. Additionally, the 'Contacts' button and logo icon gracefully reduce in size while maintaining its font size, ensuring visibility and functionality throughout your exploration.
